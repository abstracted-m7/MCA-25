1.	Create a list of integers from 1 to 10.
2.	Perform:
	append(), insert() operations.
	Update and delete specific elements using index and value.
	Sort and reverse the list.
	Slice the list (e.g., first 5 elements, every second element).
	Use list comprehension to generate a list of squares of even numbers.
3.	Create tuples with:
	Mixed types (e.g., (1, "Python", 3.14)),
	Single-element tuple: (5,),
	Nested tuples: (1, (2, 3), 4).
4.	Demonstrate:
	Tuple unpacking,
	Access by indexing,
	Methods like count() and index().
5.	Create a set from a list with duplicates.
6.	Apply:
	add(), remove() methods,
	union(), intersection(), difference() with other sets.
7.	Use set comprehension to find squares of numbers divisible by 3.
