Develop a java program that stores the details of an employee in suitable variables and then display the stored information back to the user in a well formatted structure. The program should accept details such as employee id, employee name, designation, company name, and salary, store them temporarily in memory, and then retrieve and print the information to demonstrate input, processing and structured output representation. Use a getData() method to take user inputs and showData() method to display them.
