Q27.  Design a Java program that evaluates the strength of a user-entered password. The application should analyze the password string to verify compliance with basic security rules such as minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, and inclusion of numeric characters. Based on these validations, the program should categorize the password strength and display appropriate feedback. String manipulation techniques and standard Java API methods must be used for character analysis.
