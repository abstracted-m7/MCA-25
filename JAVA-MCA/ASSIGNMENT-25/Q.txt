Q25.  Design and implement a Java application that analyzes the academic performance of a group of students. The program should store marks of multiple students using appropriate array structures and process the data to compute subject-wise averages, identify the highest scorer in the class, and determine the number of students who have passed or failed based on predefined criteria. The system should be modular, using separate methods for input, computation, and result display, and must handle numeric data using suitable wrapper classes where required.
